# Connect-Four
A Program To Play Against A Connect Four AI.

As a part of my final thesis, to learn the language Java and to get an introduction to AI's, I programmed an artificial intelligence in the game Connect Four. The AI is based on 
the minimax algorithm. To reduce the computing time, I used the alpha-beta-pruning. I implemented several evaluations of the board. One evaluates the positions, 
the other counts rows and checks whether it is possible to extend them to 4. The last one counts the past moves and subtracts them from the score. 

I have programmed a GUI that looks like the original version of the Connect Four game. Also, I made a game menu to choose a game mode. The modes I implemented are the following:
Player v Player, Player v Computer and Computer v Computer. Furthermore it is possible to chose a difficulty for the AI, from 1 up to 4. A difficulty of four represents
a searching depth of eight.

I hope you enjoy playing against my AI!
